# TODOLIST:

# Sidebar-icons
# Basically copy paste this page onto person search (we can search by lended, no books taken, time overdone)
-------------
# Create the book info page (note books in stock is needed to be shown)
# Copy paste this basically into the person info page
# Add the lending and borrowing features onto the person page itself (book id has to be inputted) * later on add a camera feature :)
# Let the home page be the page to search lends (filter by time inc time dec | time, filter by overlended, lended, returned etc. | status)
# Create the browse page

# Possibly create a login system so the bottom left of sidebar can have profile

# TODO: Elements added thru script are ignoring z index wtf
# figure out the tk.raise thing
# EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ -< TODO NOW TODO >-
# Whenever an element is created (only if repaint was requested), while setting
# heirarchy we must go all the way back to the root and start a 'raise' call where
# basically we cas tk.raise() based on our slave master heirarchy until everything comes to their correct level
